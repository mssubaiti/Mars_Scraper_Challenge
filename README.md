# Mars_Scraper_Challenge

This project involves the analysis of Mars news data scraped from a Mars news website. It includes extracting the titles and preview text of the articles, performing data cleaning and analysis, and generating visualizations to gain insights from the data.

Overview:
1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table

Used the help of StackOver Flow to aid me through this process, and code from previous class sessions.
